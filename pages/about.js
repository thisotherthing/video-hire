        <p>
            There is an obvious glass ceiling that is preventing talented and capable individuals from participating in the workforce. Eligible candidates may be dropped prematurely due to bias against their gender, race, age, etc. We want to create equal employment and work opportunity to reduce bias, that may occur throughout the interviewing process.

            MatchWithoutLimits is a video interviewing platform where candidates face and voice are masked during the interview. This will allow the interviewers to understand the candidate's experience and abilities while eliminating their identity from the evaluation process.
